# Learning Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository is dedicated to storing and sharing all the materials, exercises, and projects I am developing for the **Algorithms and Data Structures** course. The goal is to consolidate my learning, document programming practices, and organize algorithm examples for future reference.

## Contents

Currently, the repository includes:

- Sorting algorithms implementations (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Basic data structures (Lists, Stacks, Queues)
- Solved exercises from the course
- Notes on important theoretical concepts

## Purpose

This project aims to:

- Consolidate the knowledge acquired in the course
- Serve as a personal study guide
- Provide code examples for other students interested in the subject
